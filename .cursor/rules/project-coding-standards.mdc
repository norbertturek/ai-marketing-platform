# Project Coding Standards

- Prefer pure functions and small composable units over large imperative flows.
- Keep imports at the top of the file; avoid inline imports.
- Handle errors explicitly; return typed failures or throw domain-specific errors.
- Validate external input at boundaries (HTTP, env, database, queue).
- Do not swallow exceptions; log context and preserve the original cause.
- Keep public APIs stable and backward compatible unless a breaking change is intentional.
- Add or update tests for every behavior change.
- Keep changes minimal: remove dead code and avoid speculative abstractions.
