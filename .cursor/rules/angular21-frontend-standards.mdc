# Angular 21 Frontend Standards

- Use standalone components, directives, and pipes by default.
- Prefer Signals APIs (`signal`, `computed`, `effect`) for local reactive state.
- Keep templates declarative and move branching/transformation logic to component code.
- Keep components focused: container components orchestrate; presentational components render.
- Use typed reactive forms for non-trivial forms; centralize validation messages.
- Use `OnPush` change detection unless there is a justified exception.
- Move HTTP access to services/facades; components should not build request details.
- Use Angular Router features (guards/resolvers) for route-level concerns.
- Add unit tests for components/services and integration tests for critical user flows.
