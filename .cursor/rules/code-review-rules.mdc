# Code Review Rules

- Prioritize correctness, security, and regression risk over style nits.
- Mark severity clearly: blocker, major, minor, suggestion.
- Verify behavior changes include tests or a clear rationale for missing tests.
- Check edge cases: null/undefined, concurrency, retries, and timeouts.
- Confirm logging/metrics coverage for new failure modes.
- Flag hidden coupling, leaky abstractions, and breaking API changes.
- Require actionable comments with concrete fixes when possible.
- Ensure docs/config/env changes are included when behavior depends on them.
